# Sleep Reminder

As many of us spend a lot of time using electronic devices, 
we often lose track of time and go to bed late, which can be harmful to our health. 
But there's no need to worry! This web app is designed to remind us to go to sleep on time so we can start the day well-rested and full of energy. 

***And the best part is that anyone with ideas for new features is welcome to implement them and contribute to the development of the app. 
So let's get creative and make this app the best it can be!***

The app should have at least the following features:

- Bedtime
- Minimum sleep duration in hours
- Desired wake-up time
- Sunset and sunrise times for the user's region
- Light/Dark mode
